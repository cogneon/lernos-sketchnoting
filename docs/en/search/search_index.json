For this purpose, here is the most essential information in a sketchnote: If you want to know more, you can read everything about lernOS at Cogneon, download the guide there or listen to this podcast with lernOS mastermind Simon D\u00fcckert. In the lernOS Sketchnote guide we will refer to specific contents of the lernOS guide or further resources. But don\u2019t stress yourself and concentrate on the contents and methods that are directly crucial for you\u2014so you still have something left for the next sprints ;) Why do I need a Learning Path for Sketchnoting? In the current VUCA -world, sketchnotes can be a super useful tool that helps you structure and deeply understand information. But they can also help you learn new things, or support you and your team to get a common picture. As with everything, the same applies to sketching: Practice makes perfect! Motivation, constructive feedback and access to useful resources are the base for practice that is fun. And you\u2019ll stick with it only if it's fun. For this purpose, we have developed the lernOS sketchnote learning path. It contains: a) An introduction to sketching & knowledge about materials and basic b) 23 katas (exercises) for the essential parts of sketchnotes c) Resources for further learning, networking and inspiration The learning path works for all \"levels\", whether you have been sketching for 5 minutes or 5 years. If you are at the very beginning, the following chapter will surely help you get started. What are Sketchnotes? \"Sketchnotes are visual notes that consist of a mixture of handwriting, drawings, hand-drawn typography, shapes and graphic elements such as arrows, boxes & lines.\" - Mike Rohde, author of The Sketchnote Handbook (Peachpit Press, 2013) *and coiner of the term sketchnote. \"Sketchnotes is scribbling while you take notes\" - Kevin Thorn, Nuggethead Who didn't paint, draw and especially scribble on all surfaces as a child? Doodling is a super-easy way to understand and share information. In her TED Talk \" Doodlers, unite! \". In her book, \"The Doodle Revolution,\" Sunni shows how strongly sketching information motivates innovation and creative thinking, by making it concise and easy to understand. Historically, we humans are visual beings. We have been using images for more than 20,000 years , and the oldest cave paintings are even older. As of publication, the oldest are in the Maltravieso cave, C\u00e1ceres, Spain, dating back more than 64,000 years . From a scientific point of view, the \" Dual Encoding Theory \" supports sketches. This theory describes that information that is encoded and stored twice\u2014in this case text and image \u2014is more firmly anchored. It can be recalled more quickly and accurately than \"simple\" text notes. The use of pen and paper, or digital stylus and tablet, therefore has immense advantages over typing on a laptop in a lecture or meeting. (see the article by Oppenheimer und Mueller ) DThe sketchnoter's deep understanding of concepts and ideas is much faster and easier than that of the \"co-writers,\" who put everything down on paper word-by-word or transcribe it to their notebook. Maybe that's because scribbling and sketching is a constructive process in the brain. We have to assemble the different elements like LEGO bricks and integrate and organize our knowledge to avoid chaos on paper. As Hazel Messenger writes in her article \" Drawing Out Ideas \" the combination of sensing, feeling, thinking and doing contributes simultaneously to sensemaking, i.e., it is constructed from all these building blocks. In summary: images, especially in combination with text, are superior to plain text for sensemaking, recall, and attention. In literature, the term Picture Superiority Effect is used to explain this phenomenon. If all this is too complex and text-heavy for you, we have created a sketchnote for you: What can I do with Sketchnotes? You can sketchnote almost anything. Here are just a few examples: Recipes Processes Organizations Stories Marketing plans Business models University lectures Math lessons Church sermons Relationship maps Stage plays Book contents So you can use sketchnotes too: Deeply understand content Focus yourself Sketch solutions to problems Find ideas Tell stories Accumulate wealth (maybe...) Muck around Improve cooperation Share knowledge with other people! Create participation and understanding Dismantle barriers Amplify voices and ideas What do I need for sketchnoting? You might think, \"that all sounds very nice, but what do I need to start sketching? Isn't it all very complicated?\" Good news\u2014it's not. The only thing you actually need is a pen and some paper you can sketch on. It could be a pad, a notebook, a napkin or even a coaster. Of course, you can also digitally create sketchnotes on a tablet. We'll discuss each in turn below. Sketchnotes with pen and paper Sketchnotes with pen and paper are the \"original\" way of making visual notes. This \"analog\" approach has many advantages. Some of them are very subjective. It is best to form your own opinion: Paper doesn't have a battery that gets exhausted just when you want to take sketchnotes.Pen and paper do not continuously distract you with notifications. If your notebook gets wet, you can dry it, and it will probably still be readable afterward. Throw your tablet in the bathtub, though\u2026 Writing and drawing on paper just feels \"right\". Pen and paper have a very intuitive user interface. In a digital age, you are almost a rebel with pen and paper. You can put a sketchnote on paper in someone's hand, and you can touch it and experience it haptically. A sheet of paper has limits. Through this limitation, you learn to focus on the essentials, the core messages over time! Pen and paper is the cheapest way to sketch! There are a few things that pen and paper are actually not so good at: To share an analog sketchnote online, you first have to scan or photograph it (the following apps are handy for this purpose: CamScanner, Office Lens, or Adobe Scan.) Copy and Paste or Cut and Paste are possible with paper, but they are very time-consuming! Corrections are not that easy. Potentially they \"disturb\" the overall picture. Enlarging and reducing elements is also not really possible ... A sheet has limits - \"Full is full\", you can't extend analog sketchnotes at will. (Except with plenty of tape...) Even if many websites tell you otherwise, you don't need any special paper or especially expensive notebooks, nor do you need costly pens. To get started, just take a sheet of paper from the printer and the first available pen on your desk. Paper and pen recommendations You can find an extensive list on the Sketchnote Hangouts website. We choose not to list brands and products here. We think sketchnotes don\u2019t need expensive pens and fancy notebooks. The simplest schwag pens and the back of a failed print are fine. A \"too beautiful\" sketchbook is sometimes just that, too beautiful. You don't dare to start \"ruining\" beauty because you're afraid of it. So: KISS - Keep it simple, stupid! Digital Sketchnotes Meanwhile, you can also do kick-ass digital sketching. For this, a tablet computer is a typical recommendation, as most smartphones are still too small, although a Samsung Galaxy Note could be enough as Opels Art shows here . Most tablets are a little more comfortable, such as the Apple iPad (Pro), the Samsung Galaxy Tab or the Microsoft Surface series. Digital sketching has immense advantages: Some apps let you quickly move, zoom in and out, cut and copy elements. Online sharing is virtually built-in. Your sketchnotes are stored on a file system and may even be searchable. Some apps offer you unlimited space to sketch (e.g. the \"unlimited canvas\" in the Concepts app), if you think of any critical points later on, you can add them at any time. Like pen and paper, sketchnoting on the tablet has a few disadvantages: With a dead battery, you're back in the dark ages. Don't drop the tablet. Neither in the bathtub nor on the floor! A tablet with a stylus (pen) is not cheap. Writing and drawing on glass feels strange, at least in the beginning. #ProTip: A matte screen protector creates a rougher surface. Many digi-sketchnoters like this slightly paper-like writing feeling. Your first sketchnotes with any app will be slow as you get used to its interface and feature set. You\u2019ll need to build expertise to get fast. The operating system notifications can be very distracting as you sketchnote. Unlimited drawing space can be overwhelming, and you want to include every little dot in your sketch note. Sometimes less is just more. Apps that can be used for sketchnoting: ProCreate - kostenpflichtig, f\u00fcr iOS (Doug Neill stellt ProCreate als Sketchnote-Tool in einem Video vor) Paper by WeTransfer (fr\u00fcher by 53) - Basisversion kostenlos, Abomodell, f\u00fcr iOS Concepts - Basisversion kostenlos, f\u00fcr iOS, Android, Windows Tayasui Sketches - Basisversion kostenlos, f\u00fcr iOS, Android GoodNotes 5 - kostenpflichtig, f\u00fcr IOS You can find a comparison of different apps at Timo and on Pixpa . Sketchnote Elements No matter what the theme is, you'll always use the same elements for your sketches. If you want to train in the fundamentals, or need some inspiration and variety, we recommend \"Sketch it \u2013 The Card Game\" by Wibke Tiedmann and Stefanie Maurer. You can download it here and use it under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license. (CC BY SA 4.0). Following examples of Sketchnote elements originate from this game. \u201e Sketch it \u2013 Das Kartenspiel \u201e von Wibke Tiedmann & Stefanie Maurer , Lizenz: CC BY-SA 4.0 . Container A container structures a sketchnote by providing a frame for other elements. Separator The separator ensures that the elements of a sketchnote are distinct from each other, thus creating order and clarity. Text Your sketchnote consists of text and graphic elements, and the text elements can also take on different shapes and colors. Symbols and Icons You can use symbols and icons in different ways when sketching. For example, you can create an personalized icon set for recurring concepts. A classic example is a glowing light bulb for an idea, or an exclamation mark for something important. Connectors and arrows Connectors and arrows are strong structural elements in sketching. They create the flow that the eye of the observer follows. They show which part follows which, for example, in a temporal or logical sequence. Connectors and arrows hold your sketchnote together. They are the natural counterpart of the separator. Characters The characters are the actors in your sketchnotes. They can be used to depict the actions and emotions of individuals but also of teams or groups in different situations. Adding faces or facial expressions can be helpful to show emotions. You can express a lot of feelings and emotions through the posture of characters as well. So whether you give the figures a face or not depends almost entirely on your style. Diagrams Diagrams are well-suited to visualizing data in a sketchnote. With a bit of practice, you can create simple but powerful charts from elements like bars, lines and circles. An awe-inspiring example of analog data visualization is the project \" Dear Data \" by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec, who sent each other postcards with hand-drawn visualizations for over a year. Sketchnote Workflows \"One and done\u201d vs. iterative Sketchnoting \"One and done\" sketchnoters create sketchnotes during a conference talk or meeting. \"One and done\" means that you're done with the sketchnote as soon as the event is over. You might have to correct or add a few small details at the end, but \"one and done\" is \"live\". Contrast this to iterative sketching, in which you work in several, but usually two, steps. During an event, an interative sketcnoter creates a rough draft version, which is then revised and finalized after the event. This allows you to work in more detail and accuracy than with the \"one and done\" approach, but can be tempting for the perfectionist to spend way much more time completing the final product. Mauro Toselli, known as @xLontrax , describes an even more in-depth process in his book \" The xLontrax Theory of the Sketchnote \": Mauro collects the material and creates the first sketchnote. Afterward, he leaves it to \u201cmature\u201d until the next session. He then examines the sketchnote in detail\u2026 \u2026before removing anything superfluous. Mauro defines the \"Eraser Critical Point\" for this. He describes it as \"the number of elements you must remove from your sketchnote to compromise its meaning.\" So his approach ensures that a sketchnote has just the right number of elements to convey the desired content. In his experience, with skilled \"one and done\" sketch artists, this complex process is automated during the sketching process. Which workflow is the right one? That depends on many things: What type of sketchnoter are you: One-and-done or iterative? What fits the current situation? How much time do you have? How do you want to use your sketchnote afterward? There is no right or wrong, sketchnote as you need it! Mauro has made a summary, especially for this learning path:","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"0300_Introduction/#introduction","text":"To make the best use of this guide, you should know something about lernOS, the foundation this guide is built upon.

This allows you to work in more detail and accuracy than with the \"one and done\" approach, but can be tempting for the perfectionist to spend way much more time completing the final product. Mauro Toselli, known as @xLontrax , describes an even more in-depth process in his book \" The xLontrax Theory of the Sketchnote \": Mauro collects the material and creates the first sketchnote. Afterward, he leaves it to \u201cmature\u201d until the next session. He then examines the sketchnote in detail\u2026 \u2026before removing anything superfluous. Mauro defines the \"Eraser Critical Point\" for this. He describes it as \"the number of elements you must remove from your sketchnote to compromise its meaning.\" So his approach ensures that a sketchnote has just the right number of elements to convey the desired content. In his experience, with skilled \"one and done\" sketch artists, this complex process is automated during the sketching process. Which workflow is the right one? That depends on many things: What type of sketchnoter are you: One-and-done or iterative? What fits the current situation? How much time do you have? How do you want to use your sketchnote afterward? There is no right or wrong, sketchnote as you need it! Mauro has made a summary, especially for this learning path:","title":"\"One and done\u201d vs. iterative Sketchnoting"},{"location":"0400_Sketchnote_Learning_Path/","text":"The Sketchnote Learning Path This course recommends that you spend 12 weeks working on a topic. That could be both a lot of time and also very little time. The katas (exercises) in this guide are designed to help you get the most out of yourself and your circle. They are designed to be suitable for both beginners and advanced students. Before you start the sprint, take some time to look at the structure and the individual katas. Sometimes there are several katas in one week.hoose one or do both, depending on your mood. There is no kata police: simply exchange katas or modify them to fit your goals better. You can also have a look at the other ernOS guides : Which katas do they suggest? Are they better suited for you? How is this learning path structured? Let's look at it from two perspectives. First, we look at when you are part of a learning circle over the twelve weeks. Then we look at the katas regarding the structure. Sketchnoting is different for everyone and will always be different for you too, depending on the situation. Nevertheless, there are essential qualities that characterize a sketchnote that bears returning to even after years, and which can be understood by your colleagues. Toselli, mentioned above, has been developing a working list of these qualities for years. We took his list and built the Katas on them. How do I find more Circle Members? A group of students studying the same thing is called a learning circle in this text. If you\u2019re eager to start, but don't know where to find other circle members, what can you do? If you are in social networks like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, post there and ask for interested people.

You can also tag the authors of the guide, so your post can be seen and forwarded more easily. Circle Organizer Checklist #ProTipp: in many cases, the weekly meeting does not have enough time for doing the exercises. Therefore we use the flipped classroom method . For each weekly, there is a kata, which each circle member prepares as \"homework,\" so you have more time to discuss the results in the weekly. This is accompanied by guiding questions, which you are welcome to add.here are also shorter katas that you do together during the weekly. You should choose your focus for the sprint: - What do you want to learn or deepen? - In which skills are you already confident? - What is challenging? - What's up right now? - What's next? - What would be a better focus for a different sprint? - Are you \u201cone-and-done\u201d but find it frustrating? - Or would you rather aim at \"practice makes progress (and fun)\" (building on Brandy Agerbeck\u2019s awesome phrase.) The katas listed here are suggestions. Think of them not as prescriptive, but as inspirational.. If there are different katas to choose from, which one fits your focus best? Or do you want to do them all? If you have your own ideas for katas (or variations) that suit your main emphasis, even better, use them! And if you share them with us or add them to the learning path yourself, you will help all the others who follow the learning path after you! (... and of course, earn some tasty karma!)

Plan when you will meet, which tools you will use and who will be the moderator. Define a circle moderator who will take care of event- and time-management. One of the biggest obstacles for a successful circle is discipline and time management, so this role is important. The moderator is not the \"boss\" of the circle, but a regular circle member who makes sure everything runs smoothly. Define the day and time of the weekly meeting and whether you meet in person or virtually. Define the tools you use for communication and documentation in the circle. Decide which of the suggested exercises you want to do in the circle and as homework. Define rules or behavioral labels that might be helpful to you. Discuss whether, when, and how you might change the circle moderation? Determine a day and time of the weekly? Decide whether weekly meetings are in person or virtual? Discuss what tools are to be used. Is it free-form? Or are you hoping to compare apples-to-apples when using the same tools. If you are in person, are you sharing a set of tools, or is each person to bring their own. Discuss were the circle will share the results? Do we use social media channels? Do you need to ask express permission of others to share their work or is it free-form? Decide how to deal with meetings where not everyone can attend. For example, if 3 participants cannot attend, is the meeting canceled? Determine the attitude and principles for your circle. For example, is this circle fun or serious? If you can't complete a task because you have other priorities during the week, that's fine. We do not create additional stress)?

Choose a goal that is really important to you and where you can make progress in the sprint. Especially for sketchnote beginners*, reaching the goal is not the top priority. The focus is not only learning the primary know-how, such as the acquisition of your own visual ABC\u2019s, but regularly practicing the newly acquired skills. And finally, the main thing is: have fun :-) To achieve optimal learning success, it is nevertheless vital to set yourself goals that motivate you and with which you can make your progress tangible and visible. You will set your goals using the SMART formula (see more on this below) or use Google's OKR method to define your goal or purpose. Think about whether you might want to work towards a specific product. This could be, for example, a sketchnote workshop for colleagues, your first graphic recording, or, or, or\u2026 Think about how you want to share your progress in the circle. There may not be enough time in the check-in. Is there a way to track your progress in your documentation tool? Define goals with the SMART formula: An excellent way to define a goal is to use the \"SMART\" method. It uses the following criteria. S pecific: Is it clear what you want to do, or is it perhaps too vague? What does or doesn\u2019t it involve? Only if you know exactly what you want to do within the limits of your project can you be sure that you will get where you want to g M easurable: What must happen so that you can say that you have reached your goal? What result do you need to see? For example, if you want to become \"better\" at something, it is not measurable without formulating \"better\" more clearly. In this case, you have to ask yourself questions like \"Better than what? How exactly do I determine \"better\"? The first point can already serve you well because the more specific you are in defining your goal, the more likely you are to get a result that you can evaluate. A ttractive: Your goal must motivate you. You have to want to achieve it if you're going to have the strength to make it come true for 12 weeks. Therefore, this point is especially important. It is best to have a goal that you have personally chosen for yourself and with which you can identify 100%. A goal that others set for you will seldom trigger the same motivation as one that came from your own heart. In some versions of the SMART formula the A also stands for achievable. This means that your goal should not be too easy. You should try a little bit harder and make it more challenging. If you stay in your comfort zone, you can rarely improve. But be careful. Overtaxing yourself doesn't help, and for most of us this learning path should bring one thing above all: a lot of fun! R ealistic: As symbolized by a crossed-out rocket in the graphic, you figuratively have to stay on the ground when defining your goals. The learning path is 12 weeks, and therefore you should choose a goal that you can achieve in this time. Are you one of those people who likes to make their goals a bit more challenging? Then you should ask yourself once again whether what you have set is feasible. How much time do you have available in a week? Does the whole thing fit into the 12 weeks of the learning sprint? And if you have to say goodbye to one or the other idea, that's not that bad, because who says that the current Learning Sprint was the last one? :-) T ime-Based: Another critical requirement for your goal is a deadline for completion. In the context of the learning sprint, you can determine this date very precisely. And it\u2019s also important to be able to check, at any time, whether you are still on the right track with your work results, open points, and possible problems or obstacles. Or whether you might have to put more energy into your work on the project or maybe even adjust your goal to be able to reach it. In week 6, we will look at the intermediate results. It's an excellent time to look at your SMART goal again and, if necessary, readjust it.

If you can barely read your own handwriting, you may want to take some time to regularly practice. Another approach is to take more time to write, and seeing how it affects your readability. To do this, write a short sentence in your normal handwriting, noting the how long it took. Then write the same sentence again, taking twice as much time and maybe even more than that.
