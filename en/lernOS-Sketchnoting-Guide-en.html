<h1 id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>The verb “lernos” is the future form of “to learn” in Esperanto (mi lernos = I will learn, ni lernos = we will learn). lernOS is an operating system for lifelong learning and learning organizations. lernOS is not software, however, but “brainware.” It is a way of thinking and acting to be successful as an individual, team or organization in the 21st century. The capital “OS” in the name emphasizes the importance of digitalization for our globally connected knowledge society.</p>
<p>There are three basic guidelines described for lernOS. They represent the approach on the individual level (lernOS for you), the level of teams (lernOS for teams) and the level of organizations (lernOS for organizations). Additionally, there is the lernOS Toolbox, which explains frequently used methods and tools (e.g. Podcast, Barcamp, Sketchnoting, Expert Debriefing). lernOS was not invented anew but is a compilation of already existing and proven methods. All lernOS guides are available under the open licence Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) on the lernOS website and can be adapted to your own needs. If you have further questions regarding lernOS or need support from like-minded people, you can use the community platform CONNECT or post on Twitter with #lernOS. Note: Much of the twitter content is in German, and the mastery of lernOS is a question of months or years, not hours or days.</p>
<p>So: Keep Calm &amp; Sketch On!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>To make the best use of this guide, you should know something about lernOS, the foundation this guide is built upon. For this purpose, here is the most essential information in a sketchnote:</p>
<figure>
<img src="sketchnotes/lernos_in_a_nutshell.png" alt="lernOS in an Nutshell" /><figcaption>lernOS in an Nutshell</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you want to know more, you can read everything about lernOS at Cogneon, download the guide there or listen to <a href="https://colearn.de/clp066-aufzeichnung-cl-sprint-12-4-2019-die-kunst-des-selbstgesteuerten-lebenslangen-lernens/">this podcast</a> with lernOS mastermind Simon Dückert. In the lernOS Sketchnote guide we will refer to specific contents of the lernOS guide or further resources. But don’t stress yourself and concentrate on the contents and methods that are directly crucial for you—so you still have something left for the next sprints ;)</p>
<p><strong>Why do I need a Learning Path for Sketchnoting?</strong></p>
<p>In the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity">VUCA</a>-world, sketchnotes can be a super useful tool that helps you structure and deeply understand information. But they can also help you learn new things, or support you and your team to get a common picture.</p>
<p>As with everything, the same applies to sketching: Practice makes perfect! Motivation, constructive feedback and access to useful resources are the base for practice that is fun. And you’ll stick with it only if it’s fun.</p>

</figure>
<p>For this purpose, we have developed the lernOS sketchnote learning path. It contains:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>An introduction to sketching &amp; knowledge about materials and basic</p></li>
<li><p>23 katas (exercises) for the essential parts of sketchnotes</p></li>
<li><p>Resources for further learning, networking and inspiration</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The learning path works for all “levels”, whether you have been sketching for 5 minutes or 5 years. If you are at the very beginning, the following chapter will surely help you get started.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-sketchnotes">What are Sketchnotes?</h2>
<p><em>“Sketchnotes are visual notes that consist of a mixture of handwriting, drawings, hand-drawn typography, shapes and graphic elements such as arrows, boxes &amp; lines.”</em> <em>- Mike Rohde, author of</em> <a href="http://rohdesign.com/"><em>The Sketchnote Handbook (Peachpit Press, 2013)</em></a> *and coiner of the term sketchnote.</p>
<p><em>“Sketchnotes is scribbling while you take notes”</em> <em>- Kevin Thorn,</em> <a href="http://nuggethead.net/2013/01/what-are-sketch-notes/"><em>Nuggethead</em></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Who didn’t paint, draw and especially scribble on all surfaces as a child? Doodling is a super-easy way to understand and share information. In her TED Talk “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sunni_brown?share=11cb8401a9&amp;language=en#t-29444">Doodlers, unite!</a>”. In her book, “The Doodle Revolution,” Sunni shows how strongly sketching information motivates innovation and creative thinking, by making it concise and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Historically, we humans are visual beings. We have been using images for more than <a href="https://journal.lib.uoguelph.ca/index.php/perj/article/view/3137">20,000 years</a>, and the oldest cave paintings are even older. As of publication, the oldest are in the Maltravieso cave, Cáceres, Spain, dating back more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting">64,000 years</a>.</p>
<p>From a scientific point of view, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-coding_theory">Dual Encoding Theory</a>” supports sketches. This theory describes that information that is encoded and stored twice—in this case text and image —is more firmly anchored. It can be recalled more quickly and accurately than “simple” text notes. The use of pen and paper, or digital stylus and tablet, therefore has immense advantages over typing on a laptop in a lecture or meeting. (see the article by <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614524581">Oppenheimer und Mueller</a>) DThe sketchnoter’s deep understanding of concepts and ideas is much faster and easier than that of the “co-writers,” who put everything down on paper word-by-word or transcribe it to their notebook.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s because scribbling and sketching is a constructive process in the brain. We have to assemble the different elements like LEGO bricks and integrate and organize our knowledge to avoid chaos on paper. As Hazel Messenger writes in her article “<a href="https://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=18359442&amp;AN=120666112&amp;h=j66cPhqDECmzFTzdusRYarMmVfAAlKKDXnRef90BzvF9NuVMYq8%2fTh%2fERMpVyXIr8FJNnm8i0T0Vhw%2fkJW0hZQ%3d%3d&amp;crl=f&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d18359442%26AN%3d120666112">Drawing Out Ideas</a>” the combination of sensing, feeling, thinking and doing contributes simultaneously to sensemaking, i.e., it is constructed from all these building blocks.</p>
<p>In summary: images, especially in combination with text, are superior to plain text for sensemaking, recall, and attention. In literature, the term <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-13423-001">Picture Superiority Effect</a> is used to explain this phenomenon.</p>
<p>If all this is too complex and text-heavy for you, we have created a sketchnote for you:</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-do-with-sketchnotes">What can I do with Sketchnotes?</h2>
<p>You can sketchnote almost anything. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recipes</li>
<li>Processes</li>
<li>Organizations</li>
<li>Stories</li>
<li>Marketing plans</li>
<li>Business models</li>
<li>University lectures</li>
<li>Math lessons</li>
<li>Church sermons</li>
<li>Relationship maps</li>
<li>Stage plays</li>
<li>Book contents</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can use sketchnotes too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeply understand content</li>
<li>Focus yourself</li>
<li>Sketch solutions to problems</li>
<li>Find ideas</li>
<li>Tell stories</li>
<li>Accumulate wealth (maybe…)</li>
<li>Muck around</li>
<li>Improve cooperation</li>
<li>Share knowledge with other people!</li>
<li>Create participation and understanding</li>
<li>Dismantle barriers</li>
<li>Amplify voices and ideas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-for-sketchnoting">What do I need for sketchnoting?</h2>
<p>You might think, “that all sounds very nice, but what do I need to start sketching? Isn’t it all very complicated?” Good news—it’s not. The only thing you actually need is a pen and some paper you can sketch on. It could be a pad, a notebook, a napkin or even a coaster. Of course, you can also digitally create sketchnotes on a tablet. We’ll discuss each in turn below.</p>
<h3 id="sketchnotes-with-pen-and-paper">Sketchnotes with pen and paper</h3>
<p>Sketchnotes with pen and paper are the “original” way of making visual notes. This “analog” approach has many advantages. Some of them are very subjective. It is best to form your own opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper doesn’t have a battery that gets exhausted just when you want to take sketchnotes.Pen and paper do not continuously distract you with notifications.</li>
<li>If your notebook gets wet, you can dry it, and it will probably still be readable afterward. Throw your tablet in the bathtub, though…</li>
<li>Writing and drawing on paper just feels “right”.</li>
<li>Pen and paper have a very intuitive user interface.</li>
<li>In a digital age, you are almost a rebel with pen and paper.</li>
<li>You can put a sketchnote on paper in someone’s hand, and you can touch it and experience it haptically.</li>
<li>A sheet of paper has limits. Through this limitation, you learn to focus on the essentials, the core messages over time!</li>
<li>Pen and paper is the cheapest way to sketch!</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few things that pen and paper are actually not so good at:</p>
<ul>
<li>To share an analog sketchnote online, you first have to scan or photograph it (the following apps are handy for this purpose: CamScanner, Office Lens, or Adobe Scan.)</li>
<li>Copy and Paste or Cut and Paste are possible with paper, but they are very time-consuming!</li>
<li>Corrections are not that easy. Potentially they “disturb” the overall picture.</li>
<li>Enlarging and reducing elements is also not really possible …</li>
<li>A sheet has limits - “Full is full”, you can’t extend analog sketchnotes at will. (Except with plenty of tape…)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if many websites tell you otherwise, you don’t need any special paper or especially expensive notebooks, nor do you need costly pens. To get started, just take a sheet of paper from the printer and the first available pen on your desk.</p>
<h4 id="paper-and-pen-recommendations">Paper and pen recommendations</h4>
<p>You can find an extensive list on the <a href="https://sketchnotehangout.com/resources/">Sketchnote Hangouts</a> website.</p>
<p>We choose not to list brands and products here. We think sketchnotes don’t need expensive pens and fancy notebooks. The simplest schwag pens and the back of a failed print are fine.</p>
<p>A “too beautiful” sketchbook is sometimes just that, too beautiful. You don’t dare to start “ruining” beauty because you’re afraid of it. So: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS - Keep it simple, stupid!</a></p>
<h3 id="digital-sketchnotes">Digital Sketchnotes</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also do kick-ass digital sketching. For this, a tablet computer is a typical recommendation, as most smartphones are still too small, although a Samsung Galaxy Note could be enough as Opels Art shows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lai-GBlRq9Y">here</a>. Most tablets are a little more comfortable, such as the Apple iPad (Pro), the Samsung Galaxy Tab or the Microsoft Surface series.</p>
<p>Digital sketching has immense advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some apps let you quickly move, zoom in and out, cut and copy elements.</li>
<li>Online sharing is virtually built-in.</li>
<li>Your sketchnotes are stored on a file system and may even be searchable.</li>
<li>Some apps offer you unlimited space to sketch (e.g. the “unlimited canvas” in the Concepts app), if you think of any critical points later on, you can add them at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like pen and paper, sketchnoting on the tablet has a few disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a dead battery, you’re back in the dark ages.</li>
<li>Don’t drop the tablet. Neither in the bathtub nor on the floor!</li>
<li>A tablet with a stylus (pen) is not cheap.</li>
<li>Writing and drawing on glass feels strange, at least in the beginning. #ProTip: A matte screen protector creates a rougher surface. Many digi-sketchnoters like this slightly paper-like writing feeling.</li>
<li>Your first sketchnotes with any app will be slow as you get used to its interface and feature set. You’ll need to build expertise to get fast.</li>
<li>The operating system notifications can be very distracting as you sketchnote.</li>
<li>Unlimited drawing space can be overwhelming, and you want to include every little dot in your sketch note. Sometimes less is just more.</li>

<h2 id="sketchnote-elements">Sketchnote Elements</h2>
<p>No matter what the theme is, you’ll always use the same elements for your sketches. If you want to train in the fundamentals, or need some inspiration and variety, we recommend “Sketch it – The Card Game” by Wibke Tiedmann and Stefanie Maurer. You can download it <a href="https://sketchnotegame.wordpress.com/download-kartenspiel/">here</a>and use it under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license. (CC BY SA 4.0). Following examples of Sketchnote elements originate from this game.</p>

<h3 id="container">Container</h3>
<p>A container structures a sketchnote by providing a frame for other elements.</p>
<p><img src="sketchnotes/container.png" id="small" class="left" data-align="left" height="250" /></p>
<h3 id="separator">Separator</h3>
<p>The separator ensures that the elements of a sketchnote are distinct from each other, thus creating order and clarity.</p>
<p><img src="sketchnotes/separators.png" id="small" class="right" data-align="right" height="250" /></p>
<h3 id="text">Text</h3>
<p>Your sketchnote consists of text and graphic elements, and the text elements can also take on different shapes and colors.</p>
<p><img src="sketchnotes/text.png" id="small" class="left" data-float="left" height="250" /></p>
<h3 id="symbols-and-icons">Symbols and Icons</h3>
<p>You can use symbols and icons in different ways when sketching. For example, you can create an personalized icon set for recurring concepts. A classic example is a glowing light bulb for an idea, or an exclamation mark for something important.</p>
<p><img src="sketchnotes/visual_alphabet.png" id="small" class="right" data-float="right" height="250" /></p>
<h3 id="connectors-and-arrows">Connectors and arrows</h3>
<p>Connectors and arrows are strong structural elements in sketching. They create the flow that the eye of the observer follows. They show which part follows which, for example, in a temporal or logical sequence. Connectors and arrows hold your sketchnote together. They are the natural counterpart of the separator.</p>
<p><img src="sketchnotes/connectors.png" id="small" class="left" data-float="left" height="250" /></p>
<h3 id="characters">Characters</h3>
<p>The characters are the actors in your sketchnotes. They can be used to depict the actions and emotions of individuals but also of teams or groups in different situations. Adding faces or facial expressions can be helpful to show emotions. You can express a lot of feelings and emotions through the posture of characters as well. So whether you give the figures a face or not depends almost entirely on your style.</p>
<p><img src="sketchnotes/figures.png" id="small" class="left" data-float="left" height="250" /></p>
<h3 id="diagrams">Diagrams</h3>
<p>Diagrams are well-suited to visualizing data in a sketchnote. With a bit of practice, you can create simple but powerful charts from elements like bars, lines and circles. An awe-inspiring example of analog data visualization is the project “<a href="http://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data</a>” by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec, who sent each other postcards with hand-drawn visualizations for over a year.</p>

<h3 id="one-and-done-vs.-iterative-sketchnoting">“One and done” vs. iterative Sketchnoting</h3>
<p>“One and done” sketchnoters create sketchnotes during a conference talk or meeting. “One and done” means that you’re done with the sketchnote as soon as the event is over. You might have to correct or add a few small details at the end, but “one and done” is “live”.</p>
<p>Contrast this to iterative sketching, in which you work in several, but usually two, steps. During an event, an interative sketcnoter creates a rough draft version, which is then revised and finalized after the event. This allows you to work in more detail and accuracy than with the “one and done” approach, but can be tempting for the perfectionist to spend way much more time completing the final product.</p>
<p>Mauro Toselli, known as <span class="citation" data-cites="xLontrax">[@xLontrax]</span>(https://twitter.com/xlontrax), describes an even more in-depth process in his book “<a href="https://www.maurotoselli.com/the-xlontrax-theory-of-sketchnote.html">The xLontrax Theory of the Sketchnote</a>”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mauro collects the material and creates the first sketchnote.</li>
<li>Afterward, he leaves it to “mature” until the next session.</li>
<li>He then examines the sketchnote in detail…</li>
<li>…before removing anything superfluous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mauro defines the “Eraser Critical Point” for this. He describes it as “the number of elements you must remove from your sketchnote to compromise its meaning.” So his approach ensures that a sketchnote has just the right number of elements to convey the desired content. In his experience, with skilled “one and done” sketch artists, this complex process is automated during the sketching process.</p>
<p>Which workflow is the right one? That depends on many things:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of sketchnoter are you: One-and-done or iterative?</li>
<li>What fits the current situation?</li>
<li>How much time do you have?</li>
<li>How do you want to use your sketchnote afterward?</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no right or wrong, sketchnote as you need it!</p>
<p>Mauro has made a summary, especially for this learning path:</p>

<h1 id="the-sketchnote-learning-path">The Sketchnote Learning Path</h1>
<p>This course recommends that you spend 12 weeks working on a topic. That could be both a lot of time and also very little time. The katas (exercises) in this guide are designed to help you get the most out of yourself and your circle. They are designed to be suitable for both beginners and advanced students. Before you start the sprint, take some time to look at the structure and the individual katas. Sometimes there are several katas in one week.hoose one or do both, depending on your mood. There is no kata police: simply exchange katas or modify them to fit your goals better. You can also have a look at the other <a href="https://github.com/cogneon/">LernOS guides</a>: Which katas do they suggest? Are they better suited for you?</p>
<p><strong>How is this learning path structured?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at it from two perspectives. First, we look at when you are part of a learning circle over the twelve weeks. Then we look at the katas regarding the structure.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Sketchnoting is different for everyone and will always be different for you too, depending on the situation. Nevertheless, there are essential qualities that characterize a sketchnote that bears returning to even after years, and which can be understood by your colleagues. Toselli, mentioned above, has been developing a working list of these qualities for years. We took his list and built the Katas on them.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-find-more-circle-members">How do I find more Circle Members?</h2>
<p>A group of students studying the same thing is called a learning circle in this text. If you’re eager to start, but don’t know where to find other circle members, what can you do?</p>
<p>If you are in social networks like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, post there and ask for interested people. If you use the hashtags #lernOS and #sketchnoting in your post, people following those threads will see it as well. You can also tag the authors of the guide, so your post can be seen and forwarded more easily.</p>
<h2 id="circle-organizer-checklist">Circle Organizer Checklist</h2>
<p><strong>#ProTipp:</strong> in many cases, the weekly meeting does not have enough time for doing the exercises. Therefore we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom">flipped classroom method</a>. For each weekly, there is a kata, which each circle member prepares as “homework,” so you have more time to discuss the results in the weekly. This is accompanied by guiding questions, which you are welcome to add.here are also shorter katas that you do together during the weekly.</p>
<p>You should choose your focus for the sprint: - What do you want to learn or deepen? - In which skills are you already confident? - What is challenging? - What’s up right now? - What’s next? - What would be a better focus for a different sprint? - Are you “one-and-done” but find it frustrating? - Or would you rather aim at “practice makes progress (and fun)” (building on Brandy Agerbeck’s awesome phrase.)</p>

</figure>
<p>The katas listed here are suggestions. Think of them not as prescriptive, but as inspirational.. If there are different katas to choose from, which one fits your focus best? Or do you want to do them all? If you have your own ideas for katas (or variations) that suit your main emphasis, even better, use them! And if you share them with us or add them to the learning path yourself, you will help all the others who follow the learning path after you! (… and of course, earn some tasty karma!)</p>
<p>On the following pages, you will find a short version of the sprint schedule. The explanations for the individual katas and warm-ups follow on the pages after that.</p>

</ul>
<p>This week there is no clearly defined program with further exercises. You already presented the results of your work in week 1. Now is the time to finish the sprint together. Talk about the circle and your experiences in the last weeks. What have you learned and what has the learning path done to you. How can you continue after the sprint?</p>
<p>Wow, you did it and finished the sprint! Congratulations! How can it continue? Some circles continue to meet regularly, but in longer intervals (e.g. every 2 or 4 weeks instead of every week). In this way, you can work on specific topics from the learning path in greater depth or katas, and repeat warm-ups. How about a new iteration of the Sketchnote Learning Path with new goals and focus?</p>
<p>I’m sure your circle has its ideas about what you want to work on. You might bring in application ideas from your fields of work or interest and create exercises from them.</p>
<p>Discuss what you want to fill in the weeks after the sprint, because it’s essential to keep up with it to strengthen further the skills and positive habits you have built up during the sprint. Be sure also to discuss how you want to proceed with the shared resources you have (online platforms, sketches from the others, etc.)</p>

<li>With a Sketchnote Selfie, you show yourself and the others what you already know.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kata-2-circle-setup">Kata 2: Circle Setup</h2>
<p>Used in Week 0</p>
<p>If you do not know each other in the circle yet, get to know each other in week 0. Plan when you will meet, which tools you will use and who will be the moderator. Define a circle moderator who will take care of event- and time-management. One of the biggest obstacles for a successful circle is discipline and time management, so this role is important. The moderator is not the “boss” of the circle, but a regular circle member who makes sure everything runs smoothly. Define the day and time of the weekly meeting and whether you meet in person or virtually. Define the tools you use for communication and documentation in the circle. Decide which of the suggested exercises you want to do in the circle and as homework. Define rules or behavioral labels that might be helpful to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss whether, when, and how you might change the circle moderation?</li>
<li>Determine a day and time of the weekly?</li>
<li>Decide whether weekly meetings are in person or virtual?</li>
<li>Discuss what tools are to be used. Is it free-form? Or are you hoping to compare apples-to-apples when using the same tools. If you are in person, are you sharing a set of tools, or is each person to bring their own.</li>
<li>Discuss were the circle will share the results? Do we use social media channels? Do you need to ask express permission of others to share their work or is it free-form?</li>
<li>Decide how to deal with meetings where not everyone can attend. For example, if 3 participants cannot attend, is the meeting canceled?</li>
<li>Determine the attitude and principles for your circle. For example, is this circle fun or serious? If you can’t complete a task because you have other priorities during the week, that’s fine. We do not create additional stress)?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To gain clarity in the circle about the procedure and the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kata-3-feedback">Kata 3: Feedback!</h2>

</figure>
<p>An essential function of the circle is to get feedback on your goals and sketches and to give feedback to others. To help you understand each other better, take a few moments to talk about your idea of constructive feedback, including the question “Why do you visualize? And the principle”Compare yourself with yourself".</p>

<h2 id="kata-4-my-goals-for-the-next-4-weeks">Kata 4: My goals for the next 4 weeks</h2>
<p>Used in Week 1</p>
<p>What do you want to achieve in the next twelve weeks? Choose a goal that is really important to you and where you can make progress in the sprint. Especially for sketchnote beginners*, reaching the goal is not the top priority. The focus is not only learning the primary know-how, such as the acquisition of your own visual ABC’s, but regularly practicing the newly acquired skills. And finally, the main thing is: have fun :-) To achieve optimal learning success, it is nevertheless vital to set yourself goals that motivate you and with which you can make your progress tangible and visible. You will set your goals using the SMART formula (see more on this below) or use Google’s OKR method to define your goal or purpose. Think about whether you might want to work towards a specific product. This could be, for example, a sketchnote workshop for colleagues, your first graphic recording, or, or, or…</p>
<p>Think about how you want to share your progress in the circle. There may not be enough time in the check-in. Is there a way to track your progress in your documentation tool?</p>
<p><strong>Define goals with the SMART formula:</strong></p>
<figure>
<img src="sketchnotes/smart_goals.png" alt="SMART goals by @ben1kk CC-BY" id="mid" class="center" height="200" /><figcaption>SMART goals by <span class="citation" data-cites="ben1kk">@ben1kk</span> CC-BY</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An excellent way to define a goal is to use the “SMART” method. It uses the following criteria.</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>pecific: Is it clear what you want to do, or is it perhaps too vague? What does or doesn’t it involve? Only if you know exactly what you want to do within the limits of your project can you be sure that you will get where you want to g</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>easurable: What must happen so that you can say that you have reached your goal? What result do you need to see? For example, if you want to become “better” at something, it is not measurable without formulating “better” more clearly. In this case, you have to ask yourself questions like “Better than what? How exactly do I determine”better"? The first point can already serve you well because the more specific you are in defining your goal, the more likely you are to get a result that you can evaluate.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>ttractive: Your goal must motivate you. You have to want to achieve it if you’re going to have the strength to make it come true for 12 weeks. Therefore, this point is especially important. It is best to have a goal that you have personally chosen for yourself and with which you can identify 100%. A goal that others set for you will seldom trigger the same motivation as one that came from your own heart. In some versions of the SMART formula the A also stands for achievable. This means that your goal should not be too easy. You should try a little bit harder and make it more challenging. If you stay in your comfort zone, you can rarely improve. But be careful. Overtaxing yourself doesn’t help, and for most of us this learning path should bring one thing above all: a lot of fun!</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>ealistic: As symbolized by a crossed-out rocket in the graphic, you figuratively have to stay on the ground when defining your goals. The learning path is 12 weeks, and therefore you should choose a goal that you can achieve in this time. Are you one of those people who likes to make their goals a bit more challenging? Then you should ask yourself once again whether what you have set is feasible. How much time do you have available in a week? Does the whole thing fit into the 12 weeks of the learning sprint? And if you have to say goodbye to one or the other idea, that’s not that bad, because who says that the current Learning Sprint was the last one? :-)</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>ime-Based: Another critical requirement for your goal is a deadline for completion. In the context of the learning sprint, you can determine this date very precisely. And it’s also important to be able to check, at any time, whether you are still on the right track with your work results, open points, and possible problems or obstacles. Or whether you might have to put more energy into your work on the project or maybe even adjust your goal to be able to reach it. In week 6, we will look at the intermediate results. It’s an excellent time to look at your SMART goal again and, if necessary, readjust it.</p>

<h2 id="kata-5-an-appointment-with-yourself">Kata 5: An appointment with yourself</h2>
<p>Used in Week 1</p>
<p>Do you take enough time for your personal development and for working towards your goals? Many people are so busy with their daily lives that they neglect their own progress and well-being. A valuable approach is to make an appointment with yourself and reserve this time in your calendar.</p>
<p><strong>Practice (15 minutes):</strong></p>
<p>Check your calendar and look for possible appointments with yourself. An hour or even 30 minutes per week is a good starting point. Make an appointment with yourself on the calendar. If possible, make it recurring so that this time with yourself becomes a habit for you. Find at least five appointments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>…</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Discuss your approaches in the circle..</p>

<h2 id="kata-6-letter-your-favourite-saying">Kata 6: Letter your favourite saying</h2>
<p>Used in Week 2</p>
<p>A sketchnote can be designed and structured very well with different fonts and sizes. But often we fall back into our habits when sketching and always use the same old letters.</p>
<p>Take a DIN-A5 sheet (Half of an 8.5x11 in America) and a not-too-long quote of your choice for this kata. Think about which words you want to write in which font and in which size. What is especially important? What emotions resonate? Perhaps you make a small pencil sketch for the proportions and then draw in clean lines. If you need inspiration for fonts, check out the corresponding cards in the Sketchnote Game.</p>

<h2 id="kata-7-take-your-time-while-writing">Kata 7: Take your time while writing</h2>
<p>Used in Week 2</p>
<p>A key thing for an excellent sketchnote is its readability. Especially when we tap on keyboards far too much and don’t write much by hand in everyday life, the handwriting practice from primary school is often just a pale memory.</p>
<p>In the appendix, you will find a practice sheet on “Architect’s Handwriting”, which is known for its excellent readability. If you can barely read your own handwriting, you may want to take some time to regularly practice.</p>
<p>Another approach is to take more time to write, and seeing how it affects your readability. To do this, write a short sentence in your normal handwriting, noting the how long it took. Then write the same sentence again, taking twice as much time and maybe even more than that. Look at the letters carefully. What changes? Accelerate again gradually and try to keep the positive changes.</p>

<h2 id="kata-17-feedback-on-content">Kata 17: Feedback on content</h2>
<p>Used in Week 8</p>
<p>For sketchnotes, active listening and capturing the essential information (core theses), for example a lecture, is critical. This Kata is about actively asking for feedback on your Sketchnote from the outside.</p>
<p>Depending on the setting in which you create your sketchnote, there are different ways to get feedback. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Sketchnote created at an event:</li>
</ol>
<p>Why not go directly to the presenters and event organizers and ask them for feedback on the content of your sketchnote? Was the information fully collected? Are the core theses included?</p>
<p>If there are multiple sketches from different sketchnoters of the presentation, you could compare the informational content of the sketches and rate the information you gathered.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Sketchnote created at a meeting:</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of a session, you could ask participants to provide feedback on your sketchnote. Are the participants of the opinion that you’ve captured the key points from the meeting and weighted them appropriately?</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>Sketchnote created about a trip:</li>
</ol>
<p>Ask your travel companions, such as family or friends, whether their experiences and impressions resonate in your sketchnote.</p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>Sketchnote created about a particular topic:</li>
</ol>
<p>You could post your sketchnote on social media and ask for feedback. Ask concrete questions about what you want to get feedback on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share with your circle the experiences about how to get feedback on the content of your sketchnote (20 minutes).</li>
<li>Talk about your findings and reflect on how feedback on the content of your sketchnote can help you improve your skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To practice your sketchnote skills in a business context and expand your comfort zone.</li>
<li>To know what you can do well when creating a Sketchnote.</li>

<ul>
<li>What did you particularly like?</li>
<li>Is there something missing that inspired you, or something that lets you see sketchnoting from a completely different perspective?</li>
</ul>
<p>Write down a list of your top 5 and present your lists in the weekly. Find a way to show the lists to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To get an overview of other sources of knowledge on the Internet.</li>
<li>You will realize which sources are useful for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kata-19-soulshine-selfie">Kata 19: Soulshine-Selfie</h2>
<p>Used in Week 9</p>
<p>What are you personally thankful for in your life? It can be things, people, but also situations or special memories? Do you think about the sunny side of life and beautiful things often enough? We all experience it far too often and we forget the happy moments far too quickly. We tend to only concentrate on our problems.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise (30 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>Create a sketchnote of things you like, love, and simply appreciate in your life. Draw yourself in the center, e.g. in front of a “sun” and arrange your “sources of happiness” around it. Give each of them a caption or a short text. Thereby you will benefit from the “Dual-Encoding Theory” and keep them better anchored in your memory.</p>

<h2 id="kata-22-pictionary-originally-montagsmaler">Kata 22: Pictionary (originally “Montagsmaler”)</h2>
<p>Used in Week 10</p>
<p>The “Montagsmaler” was a programme on German TV, in which several team members guessed terms that a member of the team had drawn. To start this exercise, you need some terms that represent specific things, such as train or elephant. Make sure to pick concrete nouns that are not abstract. This online Thesaurus can randomly select words, so you can use it to support word-finding:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.palabrasaleatorias.com/zufallige-worter.php">https://www.palabrasaleatorias.com/zufallige-worter.php</a></p>
<p>also available in English:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.palabrasaleatorias.com/random-words.php">https://www.palabrasaleatorias.com/random-words.php</a></p>
<p>In turn, each Circle Member picks a word and draws it, the others guess what it is. The aim is to draw something, to overcome the inhibition of drawing and above all, to find out how little it often takes to make a word clear. This exercise is therefore particularly suitable for a “warm-up” after the first exercises. It is also an excellent task later on when your skills are growing. Then verbs that show figures in action, such as walking, dancing, or thinking, become very useful.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will get feedback on the recognizability of your drawing: What is essential for something to be recognized?</li>
<li>To learn to overcome your inhibitions of drawing.</li>
<li>To repeat what you have learned and apply it in combination</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kata-23-measure-show-your-success">Kata 23: Measure &amp; show your success</h2>
<p>Used in Week 11</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have arrived at the final Kata of this circle. Now it is time to measure your success over the last few weeks and make it show.</p>
<p>If you have worked on a product as a project, then finalize it. Look back to where you started. What challenges have you mastered while creating the product?</p>
<p>You didn’t work on a specific product? Then look back at the last weeks in the circle. What has mainly influenced or moved you in the past weeks?</p>
<p>You can use the spider web graphic in the appendix to show your progress. Think about different areas, such as layout/structure, picture vocabulary, live sketching. Then estimate on a scale of 0-10: Where did you stand at the beginning of the circle? Where are you now? That way you can visualize your progress.</p>
<p>If you have worked with OKRs for your goals, evaluate their progress. For example, use the OKR tracking chart in the appendix.</p>
<p>And don’t forget: Congratulate yourself for this circle and the last few weeks!</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To get clarity regarding your goal achievement.</li>
<li>To will get feedback from the Circle Members to build up on this.</li>

<h1 id="stop-talking.-start-doing">Stop talking. Start doing!</h1>
<p>If you have read this guide, but have not yet actively implemented lernOS, you should start now! Starting with lernOS is easy. These five steps will help you to get started smoothly:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make time: Define when you want to start with lernOS. Enter the times for the weekly in the calendar. This regular appointment is especially necessary if you practice lernOS in a circle.</li>
<li>Define goals and key results: Use week 0 to set your goals and measurable results for the sprint. Choose a goal that you really care about.</li>
<li>Start a circle: Look for 3-4 allies who want to start a sprint at the same time. If someone has already been in another circle, that person can take over the role of Circle Moderator.</li>
<li>Organize the weekly: if you do not know each other in the circle, it is best to meet in week 0 in person. (This advice must be put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic.) Use social networks or messengers to communicate between meetings. Use video conferencing to organize virtual meetings.</li>
<li>Plan, Do, Learn, Repeat: Use the last Weekly in week 12 to reflect on the results and the cooperation in the circle. Decide if you want to go through another sprint together.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Keep Calm &amp; Sketch On!</strong></p>
