## Week 3: Visual Vocabulary

Each language consists of individual elements: Develop the visual elements that best suit your visual language and find your style.

This guide brings together many resources (books, videos, social media accounts). You can also find inspiration there and use these resources as a source of inspiration.

You can use the current sprint as an opportunity to start working on your visual vocabulary or to collect visual vocabulary on a specific topic. Maybe this will be your project for this sprint.
