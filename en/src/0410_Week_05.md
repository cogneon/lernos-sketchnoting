## Week 5: Structure through layout

Week 5 is all about order: Sort and group all the elements used so far and combine them into a coherent layout.

**As preparation**

- [ ] [Kata 13](0500_Kata_13.md): Layouts for sketchnotes

**In the weekly**

- [ ] Check-in (2 minutes per member)

- [ ] Warm-up: Container (5 minutes)

Draw various containers and discuss what they are suitable for. (For example, a cloud stands for an idea rather than a result/decision).

- [ ] [Kata 14](0500_Kata_14.md): Video sketching (40 min)

- [ ] Check-out (1 minute per member)
