## Week 9: Deepening your Project

Setting the course for the final sprint: Develop your project further or deepen what you have learned so far—use the feedback for further self improvement.

**As preparation**

Decide what priorities you want to set.

- [ ] If you are working on your project that you would like to complete by week 11, in this sprint take the time to work on it again and get feedback on it.

- [ ] If you don't have a concrete project/product, then use [Kata 19](0500_Kata_19.md) and [20](0500_Kata_20.md)/[21](0500_Kata_21.md) to reflect on the sprint and what you have learned so far.

- [ ] [Kata 19](0500_Kata_19.md): Soulshine-Selfie

- [ ] [Kata 20](0500_Kata_20.md): Reflecting sketchnote (Part 1) "Structural Thoughts”
