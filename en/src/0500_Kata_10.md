## Kata 10: What do colours mean to you?

Used in [Week 4](0410_Week_04.md)

Colours convey emotions more directly than any layout. Answer the following questions for yourself.

- Which colours do you like?
- Which colours do you use for your sketchnotes?
- Do you use colours consistently?
- What functions do colours fulfil for you?
- How can you use colours as code?

Share and compare your results.

- Are there differences in perception?
- Does this change anything for you?
