## Kata 11: #NeverEnoughPens

Used in [Week 4](0410_Week_04.md)

You can never have enough pens ;-) But to begin, one black,one grey and an additional colour are enough. Have a look at other sketchnotes and plan for yourself which pens you need. With which line thickness can you draw and write with best? Which colours suit your themes? Draw individual motives with different pens and find your own style. 

Exchange ideas with each other:

- Where and how do you place shadows?
- How can colour convey meaning?

**Objective:**

- To learn which pen has what effect.
- To learn which colours have what effect.
- To know what types of shadows there are, how to draw them, and how they act.
