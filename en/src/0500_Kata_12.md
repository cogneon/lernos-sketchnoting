## Kata 12: 1 sketchnote, 5 colours

Used in [Week 4](0410_Week_04.md)

Prepare a sketchnote in black. Make multiple copies of it and prepare your colored pens. In the weekly, color your sketchnotes together in different ways.

**Suggestions for this:** 

- Color as usual.
- Color in the total opposite of your typical style
- Color according to an emotion
- Use color excessively
- Use color only for one single highlight
- Use colour as a hierarchical aid


**Objective:**

- To see the effect of the colour selection in direct comparison.
- To get clarity about which colour combinations work.
- To get inspiration for new colour combinations.
